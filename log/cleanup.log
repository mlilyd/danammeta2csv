Silkhu Phalcā, modern Phalcā, view from E (May 2020)

This Phalcā is located to the south of the Sikhu Phalcā. The inscription attached to its wall mentions that it was commissioned by Baccurāma and his three sons in VS 1981 (1924 CE). The Phalcā was maintained by Baccurāma’s grandson Śivapradāsa. Around VS 2058 (2001 CE) Surajanātha, another grandson of Baccurāma, reconstructed the Phalcā as a crudely built one-storey brick and concrete structure. It is further mentioned that the land, located to the west from this Phalcā has been secured to support religious functions and the upkeep of the Phalcā. The cremation ground situated in front of the Phalcā is used by the Mālī community of Bhājaṅgala. During the funeral nāyakhiṃ and kāhā music is played nearby the Phalcā.

Jalavināyaka Mandira, aniconic stone, view from S (April 2020)

The fragment (CHO0100-005) seen to the left is a large aniconic stone worshipped as Kvaynā Gaṇeśa. It has been enshrined in the sanctum of the temple and covered with brass plates. The temple of Chobhar is considered to be the seat (pīṭha) of the Patan’s Kvaynā Gaṇeśa and both the deities in Patan and in Chobhar are considered to be the same.

This caitya stands on a square-shaped stone platform. The caitya's vedi contains icons of Lokeśvaras, one in each of the four cardinal directions, and lion statues can be found at the corners. On top of the vedi, a statue of a nāga in an octagonal shape faces north and holds on to the upper construction. Above the nāga, one can find lines symbolising water. A blooming lotus can be found above these, and this sits underneath a rows of flames, a mantra in Rañjanā script, a vajra, and another nāga. Further lotus petals sit atop this second nāga, with one row turning down and another up. Small niches above this contain icons of Dhyānī Buddha, and there is one in each of the cardinal direction. Alongside the Buddha, images of his śakti can be found in each of the four corners. Above these icons, kumbha, harmikā, and trayodaśabhuvana have been installed. The part above the kumbha is slightly bent as it is levered up from the main body.

This caitya stands on a rectangular stone base. Images of lions can be found on the four corners of the vedi, whilst the four sides of nemi contain images of Lokeśvaras. The statue of Padmapāṇi Lokeśvara in the western niche has been very worn down. Above these statues, Buddha icons can be found. The western plinth contains an inscription that informs the reader about the construction of this caitya, which is also less well kept. The eastern plinth of the Śikharakūṭa caitya contains a stone statue of Buddha flanked by Prajñāpāramitā and Ṣaḍakṣarī Lokeśvara. According to local residents, this statue was found somewhere else but was then brought and established here.

Naḥ Bāhāḥcā, Aṣṭakoṇoparipadma Caitya, view from NE (January 2020)

Aṣṭakoṇoparipadma Caitya stands in the middle of the square-shaped sunken courtyard. In earlier times, rainwater collected in the courtyard due to the lack of a drainage system. As a result, the bottom of the caitya was often submerged. Locals therefore named it Pukhū Cibhā (meaning 'a caitya in a pond'). The caitya stands on the base of an octagonal plinth. Eight Bodhisattva images are placed on its eight faces. Ten layers of lotus petals can be seen on the upper part, and four Buddha statues have been placed at the bottom of the dome. The dome and harmikā have been joined together with cement plaster. The āmalaka (myrobalan) part is covered by a metal sheet. There is a fire altar to the east of the caitya.

Mūla Coka, Yantāju shrine, view from N (June 2019)

This small gilt shikhara-style temple to Yantāju stands in the middle of the courtyard. During its establishment, Taleju was first placed at the centre of the Mūla Coka where the shrine now stands. A fire altar at the north-eastern corner of the courtyard infused Śrīyantra with the life of the deity. The gilt copper inscription mentions that Śrīnivāsa Malla made this shrine in 1666 CE.

Mūla Coka, Bhidhyāpīṭa Shrine, view from E

The Vidyāpīṭha (tantric shrine) is located on the first floor of the west wing, directly above the main entrance to the palace courtyard. A similar shrine exists in the Bhaktapur palace. The shrine is made of three timber-carved cabinets containing niches. Three toraṇas are installed above the three cabinets. The altar room also contains wooden statues of Mahiṣāsuramardinī and Gaṇeśa and metal statues of the Eight Mātṛkās. A Brahmin from Tuilā ṭola used to perform the ritual worships at this temple, however, this tradition came to an end more than 40 years ago. It is likely that in historic times members of the Malla Royal family recieved tantric teachings in this room. Today, Vidyāpīṭha serves as a special exhibition gallery of the Patan Museum.

Si Bāhāḥ, dharmadhātu maṇḍala, view from S (July 2019)

Bodhisattva images can be found on the eight faces of the dharmadhātu maṇḍala and a vajra has been fixed on top. The dharmadhātu was stolen some years ago. The thieves ran away and threw it into the Pimbāhāḥ pond. It was reestablished after it was retrieved from the water. Now, it is caged inside iron rods for its protection. A metal vajra lies on the western side of the dharmadhātu.

Si Bāhāḥ, Mahākāla statue, view from E (July 2019)

The Mahākāla Cheli lies to the south of the esoteric shrine. An east-facing Mahākāla with five heads and four hands resides in the shrine. He is holding khaḍga and kartṛ in his right hands and khaṭvāṅga and kapālapātra in his left hands. Alongside this statue, there are also metal images of Amitābha, Śākyamuni, Mañjuśrī, Nāmasaṅgīti and Vajrasattva. These images were recently installed by a group of women who regularly recite Nāmasaṅgīti in the bāhāḥ. The inscription placed inside the cheli is no longer available.

This caitya stands on top of a rectangular plinth. A newly added image of Amitābha can be found on the lower part of the western side. Two layers of lotus petals are above this and are topped with images of Buddhas on each of the four directions. Above these images, one can see kumbha, harmikā, trayodaśabhuvana and a parasol. The caitya has been painted in different colours of enamel. Ilā̃ is hanging above the caitya. A deteriorated and completely illegible stone inscription stands on the ground to the west of the caitya.

Bhagavān Coka Bāhāḥ, Dharmadhātujinālaya Caitya, view from W (October 2019)

Vajrarāja Śākya made this Caitya using eight different metals. Locke (1985, 166) says that it was made of copper, but locals claim that this Caitya is gilded with an alloy of copper and zinc. A few years ago, one could find metal Buddha statues in the niches. However, the statues placed there are now made of cement. The pinnacle of the Caitya was replaced after the loss of the original one. There was a metal vajra on the western vedī, but this has now been removed due to fear of theft.

Hitiphusa Bāhāḥ, Bimba Caitya, view from E (June 2019)

 

The plinths of this Caitya have been plastered in cement. The kumbha stands above the two-layered lotus petals, and the trayodaśabhuvana section seems a bit smaller than the kumbha. Cement has been used to join different parts together, and the upper part is slightly slanted.

Hitiphusa Bāhāḥ, Vajradhātu Caitya, view from N (June 2019)

 

 

The upper part of the Caitya above the vedī appears slightly different from other vajradhātu caityas; here, one can see a vajra motif flanked by two elephants, the vehicles of Akṣobhya. On the southern side, there is a jewel motif flanked by horses, which are the vehicles of Ratnasambhava. The western side displays a lotus flower motif flanked by peacocks, the vehicles of Amitābha, whilst the northern face has a sculpted viṣvavajra flanked by Garuḍa, the vehicle of Amoghasiddhi. An oil lamp balustrade surrounds the caitya and an ilā̃, supported by four iron rods, hangs above it.

A statue of a four-headed and four-handed Mahākāla has been attached to the wall to the east of the main entrance of the bāhāḥ. He is holding khaḍga and kartṛ in his two right hands and khaṭvāṅga and kapālapātra in his two left hands.

Four Dhyānī Buddhas are shown sitting on the lotus throne. Above these Buddha images, there are three layers of lotus petals, a dome, a harmikā and thirteen spires. Four Buddhas and four Tārās have been placed on the base of the dome. A metal plate joins the harmikā to the dome. The section above the thirteen tiers is broken.

Bāghabhairava Mandira, painting of the statue of Bāghabhairava, view from E; paint by Candra Maharjana; 2012-00-00

There is a popular folk tale about the statue of Bāghabhairava in Kirtipur. 

According to the tale, while some shepherd children were grazing their sheeps in the jungle on the northern slope of Kirtipur, they were sculpting a figure of a tiger out of clay. When the figure was finished, the children went in search of a suitable leaf to use for the tiger's tongue.  However, surprisingly, when they returned with the leaf, their sheeps were missing. They wept and wailed and asked the people in the vicinity if they had seen their sheeps but no one could locate them. They guessed that the sheeps must have been eaten by the clay tiger, so they questioned him. In reply, he wide opened his mouth and the children saw that it was covered with blood. The children were angry with the tiger and decided not to fix the leaf-tongue in his mouth. Therefore, the statue of Bāghabhairava has no tongue and its mouth is wide open.

Inside the sanctum, there is a big safe box in which a small statue of Bāghabhairava (made of clay) is concealed. Locals strongly believe that this little statue of clay was sculpted by the shepherd children.

The front part of the statue is wrapped with silver, while its lower part is sculpted out of clay. In order to restore or resculpt the statue, clays from eight different places must be mixed. Seven out of eight places are in and around Kirtipur and one is Mhaipi (Kathmandu). The most recent resculpting of the statue was in 2013 CE.

Previously, a mandaḥpāḥ symbolising Mañjuśrī was worshipped here by the members of Mū Bāhāḥ as their family deity. In 2006, the image of Mañjuśrī was enshrined and this caitya was constructed. The deity is shown holding a sword in his right hand and a lotus stalk in his left hand.

Bhṛṅgāreśvara Mandira, trident (triśūla) in front of the western entrance, view from SW (October 2019)
The stone trident (triśūla) is made from a single stone and stands on a lotus pedestal. A Brahmin by the name of Nārāyaṇa offered it to Bhṛṅgāreśvara in 1614 (NS 734). Local residents decorate it on the 14th of the bright fortnight of Caitra (which is the day before the Pyakhaḥ Jātrā), coating its tip with copper and anointing its lower part with oil.

Bhṛṅgāreśvara Mandira, main śivaliṅga in the sanctum, view from W (October 2019)
This liṅga used to be worshipped by the Brāhma community (S. Jośī 2069, 26). It is placed on a lotus pedestal, though the east-western part of this is broken. Local residents believe that a priest of the temple once worshipped the liṅga whilst wearing a ring made out of kuśa grass. He had such a pure heart that it later turned into a golden ring. However, greed overcame him. He tried to produce more gold by wearing ten kuśa rings, and when this did not work, the enraged priest attacked the liṅga with an axe. This is why the liṅga is now deformed (S. Jośī 2069, 29). Another legend tells that Bhṛṅgāreśvara Māhādeva will bring the monsoon rain when he is showered with milk or if a fire ritual is performed in the temple for him (S. Jośī 2069, 28).

Cibāhāḥ Nani, full view of Śikharakūṭa Caitya, from N (January 2019)
This caitya stands on a single plinth and holds statues of Lokeśvaras and Buddhas at each of its four faces. The eastern face is also home to two lions, whilst the other three sides contain statues of the Dhyānī Buddha. A horse, the vehicle of Ratnasambhava, can also be found on the southern face, whilst the northern face is home to Garuḍa, the vehicle of Amoghasiddhi. This statue is badly worn down. 

Generally the peacock, Amitābha's vehicle, is found on the western face of a caitya, however this one has an image of an elephant seemingly in its place. Upon closer inspection, however, one can also see a small image of a peacock on top of the elephant. A stone inscription between the lions on the eastern face describes the construction of the caitya. Above this inscription are images of the three gems of Buddhism (Buddha, Prajñapāramitā and Lokeśvara).

Keku Bāhāḥ at Dau Bāhāḥ, Jvālāvali Caitya in front of the āgãchẽ, view from S (October 2018)
 

The Caitya stands on a vedī which has images of lions in each of its four corners. The lions share heads at the corners. The main body of the Caitya has been constructed in the shape of a lotus flower. At the bottom, one can see an image of a nāga facing towards the north; this supports the upper section. Above the nāga, there is a layer of lotus patels, and above this one can find a circle of a motif representing fire (jvālā). Next come two layers of lotus petals, one turned to face upward and the other downward. These petals sit beneath four images of Akṣobhya Buddha facing in four directions. Above them, one can find the kumbha, harmikā, and circles symbolising bhuvanas. 

The inscription incarved on the vedī informs the reader that the Caitya was established in NS 1003. Locke (1985: 227) misreads this date as NS 1002.

Gaṇeśa Mandira, Gaṇeśa, view from SW (July 2020)

A statue of Gaṇeśa has been erected in the sanctum of the temple. The statue has four hands, faces south, and is seated upon a mouse. He holds a rosary and a radish in his right hands and an axe and a sweet ball in his left hands. The previous Gaṇeśa statue was badly damaged, and so Kṛṣṇasiṃha Bhāro made this new one in 1787 (NS 907).

This statue of Sarasvatī has been placed to the west of the Gaṇeśa statue. The deity is shown sitting in a lalita posture and stepping on a duck with her right foot. She is holding a rosary with one of her right hands and a manuscript with one of her left hands; her other hands clasp a vīṇā. Kṛṣṇanārāyaṇa Sāhī established this statue. On the day of Śrīpañcamī, locals perform a special worship of the goddess.

This stone is located inside the temple precinct and is worshiped as Bhairava. There is a toraṇa on its side. Some people believe that if someone is bothered by evil spirits, they should worship Bhairava and he will cure them of this. This Bhairava is said to be kept under wraps, as he is very strong.

Images of monkeys have been carved into the caitya, and four statues of Buddha can be found in its niches. On top of it, one can find kumbha, harmikā, trayodaśabhūmi and a metal parasol.

This caitya is different from other caityas. There are vehicles of Buddhas in each of the four directions on the vedikā: an elephant, the vehicle of Akṣobhya, is located on the eastern side; the vehicle of Ratnasambhava, a horse, is placed on the southern side; the western side houses a peacock, which is the vehicle of Amitābha; and on the northern side one can find Garuda, the vehicle of Amogasiddhi. Monkey figures can be seen in the four corners of the vedikā. On top of this, there is a pūrṇakalaśa with lions and lotus petals with Buddhas in each of the four directions. The upper part displays kumbha, harmikā and trayodaśabhūmi. The bottom half of the caitya, from the plinth to the vedikā, seems to have been constructed in the same type of stone. However, the upper part appears to use a different stone material. The original part above the pūrṇakalaśa was stolen, and so a new one has been fixed in its place. The caitya is surrounded by a wired fence, which should serve to prevent further theft.

Sūryavināyaka Mandira, base stone (ilvahã) of gate, view from S (November 2018)

Towards the east of this temple is a street which leads from Bahalukha to Kāyegu Nanī (LAL0240) there is a base stone lying on the street touching the eastern wall of this temple. Over 30 years ago (writing now in 2019) there was a wooden gate standing over this stone which served as an entrance for Kāyegu Nanī. Now, this stone is all that is left of this gate. The Newari word lukhā means gate; the name of this ṭola (‘Bahalukha’) therefore originates from this gate, even though it was actually used to enter the bāhā (i.e. Kāyegu Nanī).

Vana Bāhāḥ, Bāhāḥcā (small monastery), view from S (January 2019)

To the east of the Vihāra one can find a residential house whose ground floor houses a sanctum (kvāḥpāḥdyaḥ). It is called a small bāhāḥ by local inhabitants. In NS 748, Dau Jittapāla established this Bāhāḥ and enshrined a golden image of Śākyamuni Buddha within it. However, this image was stolen and so in NS 884 another image, this time made of stone, was enshrined. Above the entrance of the temple one can see a wooden toraṇa with an image of Mahāvairocana in its centre. This was donated in NS 858. This old monument was heavily damaged by the 2015 earthquake. The southern part of the temple has collapsed, and the frontal facade is supported by wood.

The 16 struts containing images of Bodhisattva are fixed, with 8 supporting the northern roof and 8 supporting the southern roof of the temple. The shrine is slightly damaged and the walls are cracked.

There is a stone Jarũhiti attached to the western wall of the Phalcā. According to Furukawa/Shrestha/Bajracharya and Ogasawara 2010 (p. 121) this was built in the Malla period. Though the community cleaned and repaired the system in the 2000s, it is no longer in use because of its piped water system and water tanks. One stone inscription can be found on top of the structure. The inscription mentions its construction and the establishment of a guthi. Dãju Bhāro and Rājakarṇikāra Cikidhikala Bhāro facilitated the hiti and also donated land to fund it. The inscription also mentions the necessity of giving paddy (45 Pāthis) to a person who fills up the water in the Jarũhiti on a daily basis.

The shrine is located inside the Phalcā. It remains unclear whether the Phalcā and the shrine were constructed at the same time or if the shrine was added at a later date. Inside the shrine, an image of Gaṇeśa indicates that he is the main deity. Two brass images of rats can be found in front of this statue. 

Gaṇeśa is sitting in a sukhāsana posture on top of a mouse. He is holding an axe and laḍḍu with his left hands. One of his right hands holds a radish whilst the other one holds akṣamālā.

Above the image are two brass plate toraṇas.

Images of the Four Buddhas have been placed in the four niches above the caitya's rectangular plinth. These images have been ordered in a manner that subverts the conventional structure; Akṣobhya and Amithābha have changed places. A small caitya can be found above every niche, however there is no statue in the caitya's uppermost niche. Above the structure, one can find further statues of the Four Buddhas in each of the four directions. A harmikā, a trayodaśabhuvana and a finial have been placed above these statues. A dharmadhātu maṇḍala has been established to the west of the caitya.. There is a stone vajrā on top of the maṇḍala.

Kutisaugaḥ Phalcā, niche of inscription filled in with concrete, view from E (August 2019)

 

 

During the most recent reconstruction, an inscription was installed containing information about the private donation of statues of Gaṇeśa, Bhīmasena and Sarasvatī. However, the inscription was removed later that summer (2019) and the niche was filled with concrete. The reason behind this was that the municipality (the main donor) took issue with the inscription and refused to provide the remaining money for the reconstruction process until it was removed. Their concern was that mentioning private donors could increase the risk of the Phalcā becoming privatised later on, in that individuals might claim private ownership to it due to their contribution. This conflict has meant that the the reconstruction process has come to a halt.​ However, no hard evidence exists and this is a rumour. Regardless, this highlights an interesting and on-going contestation between private and public, as well as between religious and secular-cultural concepts.

Rādhākṛṣṇa Mandira, Garuḍa Stambha, view from S (July 2017) 

Traditionally Garuḍa pillars are erected in front of Vaiṣṇava temples. Usually a stone turtle forms the base of the pillar. The original large stone statue of Garuḍa (as seen in the 1973 photograph in Pruscha's inventory) was stolen in 1983 and later replaced with a much smaller statue of poor quality. Garuḍa greets the temple with the namaskāra gesture.

Hiti, Bhagīratha statue below the water spout, view from W (December 2019)

According to one strand of Hindu mythology, Bhagīratha was a king who pleased the goddess Gaṅgā and Lord Śiva by undertaking penance. He spent a long time sitting on the bank of Bindasura, and in doing so he managed to bring the Water Goddess (i.e., Gaṅgā) from the sky down to the earth. As a result of this, many of the conduits of the Kathmandu Valley hitis that were built before the Malla period display carved images of Bhagīratha beneath them.. The king is shown in a standing position and holding a conch with both of his hands.

A statue of a male deity is attached to the western wall of the Phalcā. Locals worship him as Lord Viṣṇu. However, it seems that this statue is in fact Vāsuki, the king of the serpents. Vāsuki generally holds a lotus stalk in his one hand and the tail of other nāga in the other. One of his hands is broken and another is not visible.

The inscription on the lower part of the statue states that the lion statue was installed by Vijayahari Siṃha in NS 853 (733 CE). This statue seems to be older than the Phalcā itself. It is evident that it was brought from somewhere else and placed here.

Bodhisattva images have been placed on the four faces of the caitya. This caitya was made by a Vajrācārya of Bu Bāhāḥ (LAL0440). The pipal tree that has grown up around the caitya has damaged it. A smaller caitya was recently established on the south-eastern plinth and a small stone Nandī has been placed at its north-eastern corner. According to locals, this caitya was established before the vihāra.

This house was built during the time of Visvajvālānanda Rājopādhyāya (Śreṣṭha 2013, 13) for Agnihotrī Brahmin couples. However, since it was impractical for couples to leave their own house and live in the Nivāsa it was used to house them only whilst they performed the daily worship. Nowadays, the Nivāsa is used during some special worships, feasts and other religious activities.

Agnimaṭha, Varūṇa tree, view from S (September 2019) 

 

A Varūṇa tree is a tree that grew from a stick that was buried by Brahmins who were on their way from Maṇicūḍa to perform fire rituals. Among the 14 Varūṇa trees in the maṭha's premises, one of them has grown out of the Maṭha wall. Although the tree obstructs the way, it is believed that it shoud not be cut at all. Passerbys must therefore make their way around the tree. A legend tells that during the Rana period a Rana arrived on a horse and was frustrated by the tree. As such, he made someone cut it. However, the khukūrī which was used to cut it broke and blood began to pour out of the tree. After a week, both the Rana and the person who atempted to cut the tree passed away. Since then, the tree has been left in peace. The priests of the Maṭha claim that the tree is 4,500 years old (Śreṣṭha B.  2007, 27). Every year, the trees flower and produce amalā sized fruits. It is belived that Brahmins would once accept the fruit and meditate for many months.

Gaṇeśa Mandira, Lukumahādyaḥ, view from E (December 2019) 

An aniconic stone idol called Lukumahādyaḥ (hiding Mahādeva) is placed in this pit. An iron fence is fixed to its opening. On the 14th day of the dark fortnight of Caitra (Piśāca Caturdaśī), the deity is worshipped with an offering of cooked rice. Michaels (1992, 193) states that ‘on this day, Śiva is supposed to become a demon, ghost or goblin (piśāca), depicted in a small stone, which is kept hidden in ‘unclean’ places such as the neighbourhood garbage dump or the courtyards.'

The Svĩsvĩdyaḥ Shrine is embedded into the western side of the plinth and consists of uniconic stones and possibly the remnants of a stone sculpture. All of the stones are heavily eroded. Respiritary problems are called svĩsvĩ in the Newari language. When someone suffers from such an ailment their relatives come to worship this deity.

Haugaḥ Phalcā at Haugaḥ, Patan, statue of Nāmasaṃgati, view from W (July 2019)

This statue of Nāmasaṅgīti is embedded in the eastern wall of the Phalcā. Nāmasaṅgīti is one of the important manifesta­tions of Mañjuśrī, the embodiment of wisdom of all the Buddhas. He has one head and twelve arms. The statue shows him seated with dhyānamudrā. His uppermost arms are raised above his head in the uttarabodhi mudrā i.e two hands folded in prostration. His two hands at breast level are in dharmacakra mudrā. Two further hands perform tarpaṇa mudrā i.e are about to offer water from the alms bowl, whilst two hands hold his alms bowl in his lap. His two shoulder-level hands hold a sword and a scripture on a lotus whilst the final two hands hold a bow and arrow.

Khvāya Bahī Taḥdhaṅgu, historical photo of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, view from E (photo by Hemarāja Śākya, 2000)

Source: Śākya 2000, 11. Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, the principal deity of the Bahī is painted white and portrayed as sitting down with his right leg raised. Locke (1985, 193) names the deity as Maitreya, whereas Sinclair (2010, 36) calls it Śrīśākyamunigaṇadevatābhaṭṭāraka. Samantabhadra is sitting in an ardhasattvaparyaṅka posture and performing the gesture of dharmacakra with his hands. H. Vajrācārya (2000, 107) mentions that a new statue of the deity was established in 25th April 1998 (12th day of Vaiśākha in the Vikrama year 2055).

Kvaylāchi Phalcā, reconstruction of Phalca (Padma Sundar Maharjan, 2019)

The rear wall construction continues under the leadership of head mason Rameśvara Prajāpati. The thick rear wall was constructed using traditional bricks in mud mortar. Dāci apā (a wedge shaped brick) was used to construct the face, and care was taken to use tvā apā (header bricks) at regular intervals to ensure a strong bond between the inner and outer layers. The line, level and plumb were checked regularly to ensure the consistent quality of the work.

View from east, showing the construction of the rear wall and the front colonnaded space. The north-south street connecting the village to Thecva in the south and Patan in the north is to the west of this Phalcā. Mason Radhesyam Prajāpati checks the plumb after placing the original stone inscription on the wall. This stone inscription was crucial in the study and making of this Phalcā, and was transliterated to understand the historicity and cultural importance of this Phalcā in this particular place.

Roof layers, Rameśvara Prajāpati and Rāmcandra, can be seen laying the final roof. Ridge tiles are laid on top of the jhingatī tiles to ensure the protection of the roof.
The tiles are designed in such a way that they interlock with each other and so stay in position. Meanwhile, the ridges of the roof are covered with special tiles known as nyākũcā (five-cornered brick). The four corners of the roof projection have special terracotta tiles known as gvangaḥcā (resembling a cock). The roof laying work was helped along with major participation from the local community.

Kvaylāchi Phalcā, reconstruction of foundation and platform (photos by Padma Sundar Maharjan, 2018)

The peripheral tie beams (Lakãsi) were connected using cross timber joists which will later receive the floor boards. Carpenters are shown making mortise grooves, which will later receive tenon from the base of carved timber posts.
After the laying of the peripheral and cross timber tie beams, masons began to construct the rear wall using dāci apā (a wedge shaped brick), and mā apā on mud mortar.

Kvaylāchi Phalcā, reconstruction of Phalca (Padma Sundar Maharjan, 2019)

The rear wall construction continues under the leadership of head mason Rameśvara Prajāpati. The thick rear wall was constructed using traditional bricks in mud mortar. Dāci apā (a wedge shaped brick) was used to construct the face, and care was taken to use tvā apā (header bricks) at regular intervals to ensure a strong bond between the inner and outer layers. The line, level and plumb were checked regularly to ensure the consistent quality of the work.

View from east, showing the construction of the rear wall and the front colonnaded space. The north-south street connecting the village to Thecva in the south and Patan in the north is to the west of this Phalcā. Mason Radhesyam Prajāpati checks the plumb after placing the original stone inscription on the wall. This stone inscription was crucial in the study and making of this Phalcā, and was transliterated to understand the historicity and cultural importance of this Phalcā in this particular place.

Roof layers, Rameśvara Prajāpati and Rāmcandra, can be seen laying the final roof. Ridge tiles are laid on top of the jhingatī tiles to ensure the protection of the roof.
The tiles are designed in such a way that they interlock with each other and so stay in position. Meanwhile, the ridges of the roof are covered with special tiles known as nyākũcā (five-cornered brick). The four corners of the roof projection have special terracotta tiles known as gvangaḥcā (resembling a cock). The roof laying work was helped along with major participation from the local community.

Mahākāla Cheli, a corridor to the north of the monastery, contains images of Hanumān, Viṣvakarmā, Mahākāla and Nāsaḥdyaḥ (Nṛtyeśvara).


	Hanumān: This small image of Hanumān does not seem to be very old. Hanumān commonly serves as the protector of monastic buildings.
	Viśvakarmā: Viśvakarmā, the god of crafts, is enshrined inside this niche without any image.
	Mahākāla: Some people worship this Mahākāla as Bhairava. No statue of Mahākāla is established; instead, one can find a curtain with three furious eyes. The curtain also contains images of kartṛ, kapālapātra, khaṭvāṅga, dogs and jackals. Only men from the monastery are allowed to open the curtain. It is believed that this Mahākāla, god of the cremation ground, used to live here before this monastery was established. To appease him, incense of human flesh is offered to him every year on the 9th day of the bright half of Āśvina. This ritual is called Lā Khāyegu.
	Nāsaḥdyaḥ: The god of music, dance and acting has no image here. A curtain showing images of three eyes, a sword, and a trident etc. serves as the symbol of the the god. People come to worship this god when they start to learn the arts.

This Aśoka Caitya is attached to the aṣṭakoṇākṛti caitya and is raised over the brick vedikā. Three niches with Buddha images can be found to the west, south and north. It is clear that the Buddha images in the niche below the kumbha were added later. The images in the southern and western niches have already been lost. A deteriorated stone inscription is attached to the western plinth of the caitya. Another caitya stands to the south west corner of this Caitya. The Buddha images that were placed in its niches have eroded over time, and the outer layers of the garbha stone have already started to fall down. The garbha and the harmikā are joined together with cement plaster. The yaḥsĩ and the cūḍāmaṇi are broken.

These are located on the eastern, southern, western and northern faces respectively. Meanwhile, Māmakī, Pāṇḍarā, Āryatārā and Locanā sit on the south-east, south-west, north-west and north-east corners respectively. The upper part of the caitya is clad in brass; this includes the kumbha. Images of the Four Busshas have also been fixed at the four faces of the kumbha. There are three holes­­—which do not seem to be niches—in the middle part of the vedī on its southern, eastern and northern faces.

Pilāchẽ Gaṇeśa, gilt copper statue of Gaṇeśa (B), view from S (June 2019)

This is the second gild copper statue of Gaṇeśa. It is in the possession of another Jyāpu family of Pilāchẽ. Like the first image, this statue is also placed inside the temple's sanctum on Kuśe Aũsī and Indrajātrā. An inscription on the pedestal of the statue mentions that Cinasiṃ Bhāva ordered that this statue be made because the previous one was too old. This occurred in NS 1002.

Pilāchẽ Gaṇeśa, gild copper statue of Gaṇeśa, view from S (June 2019)

A Jyāpu family of Pilāchẽ is in possession of this metal image of Gaṇeśa. It is similar to the Gaṇeśa image of the sanctum. This gild copper statue is placed inside the sanctum in the occasion of Kuśe Aũsī and Indrajātrā. One of the metal garlands on the statue shows the date NS 874, which suggests that this statue was made at that time or even before. We were not allowed to take a photo of this inscription.

Guji Bāhāḥ, Nāsaḥdyaḥ, view from E (July 2019)

Nāsaḥdyaḥ (Nṛtyeśvara) can be found in a niche on the western wall of the esoteric shrine. There is no image here; instead, three small holes are worshipped as the deity. The shrine is flanked by two painted images of characters holding drums. The painting below the niche has worn away. Above the niche, a toraṇa with an image of Nṛtyeśvara can be seen. This toraṇa is damaged.

Guji Bāhāḥ, aśoka caitya, view from E (July 2019)

This licchavi caitya is located outside of the bāhāḥ courtyard, in front of the northern entrance. The upper structure stands on a rectangular plinth and has three layers of empty niches. There are only 9 bhuvanas on top of the caitya, which attests to its antiquity. Āmalaka and yaḥsĩ are both clad in bronze. The caitya has been damaged by water.

Guji Bāhāḥ, Lāmā Caitya, view from N (July 2019)

This licchavi caitya is located outside the bāhāḥ courtyard, in front of its northern entrance. All four side niches of the caitya are empty and surrounded by derivative motifs. The harmikā is badly damaged. There are 11 bhuvanas on top of the harmikā. The part above the bhuvanas has also been damaged. One can also find a statue of a sitting devotee in a dhyāna posture here.

It is believed that when Sūryadeva brought the image of Trailokya Vijaya from Tibet, the Lama followed him and arrived at this bāhāḥ. When the Lama saw that Trailokya Vijaya had already been installed in the āgama of the bāhāḥ he thought that it would be better to stay, and so he sat nearby this caitya and began to meditate. Whilst meditating to his deity, he became liberated.

People worship this caitya when their children are struggling to learn how to walk. The connection between walking and this caitya originates from the Lama’s journey from Tibet to Kathmandu.

The caitya has suffered water damage and is cracked in places. The stones of the plinth, niches and the garbha of the caitya are in a deteriorated condition. The garbha and the harmikā have been attached using cement plaster, with the consequence that the harmikā is slightly covered. The image of Lāmā sitting to the north of the caitya is very worn.

Guji Bāhāḥ, Trailokyavijaya shrine, view from E (July 2019)

The āgãchẽ of the Guji Bāhāḥ contains an image of Trailokyavijaya with Hevajra. This image of Trailokyavijaya was brought from Tibet. Only the daśapāramitā aḥjus of the bāhāḥ are allowed to worship in the āgãchẽ. To make Trailokyavijaya accessible to the greater public, the deity was installed at the northern corner of the western wall of the bāhāḥ complex. There is no image; instead, a stone vajra decorated with ornaments has been established there. A bronze toraṇa can be found above the vajra, and it is flanked by kakāsyā and ulakāsyā. People worship Trailokya Vijaya in the hope of removing obstacles from their work. Before the Harisiddhi dance begins, a gvaydā̃ is offered to Trailokya Vijaya (Vajrācārya 2000, 69).

A Lama from the Potala Palace of Tibet heard about the scholar Sūryadeva, a son of Vaiśradeva, and invited him to Tibet. Whilst in Tibet, Sūryadeva came to know that a fire was ragingi in his Guji Bāhāḥ. WIth the power of some tea from his cup, he extinguished the fire. Amazed by his tantric power, the Lama requested permission to worship his deity Trailokyavijaya. Pleased with this, the Lama requested Sūryadeva to ask something from him. Sūryadeva asked for the image of Trailokya Vijaya. The Lama felt it difficult to deny this request directly, and so told him he would discuss it the following day. Sūryadeva became suspicious of the Lama and left Tibet that same night, taking with him the image of Trailokyavijaya. Upon his arrival back in the Kathmandu Valley, he established the deity in the āgama of his monastery. The physical condition of the object is good.

Guji Bāhāḥ, Acala, view from W (July 2019)

The image of Acala has been placed inside a small niche to the north of the gumbā entrance. Acala is depicted holding a sword for subduing demons in his right hand and a rope in his left hand. The image has been damaged. The repeated application of vermilion powder has destroyed the face of the deity; as such, it is now hardly recognisable. Some of the other body parts are also worn away.

Her remaining two hands hold a vīṇā. Frequent touching and the application of vermillion powder has led to the image being quite worn down.

Bhindyaḥlāchi Phalcā, relief statue of donors, view from E (March 2018)

The two donor statues show Jagata Avāle and his wife. The paintings of flower designs and five dhyānī Buddhas (Ratnasambhava, Akṣobhya, Bairaocana, Amitābha and Amoghasiddhi) at the top, as well as the paintings of parrots, svastika, eyes, and a pūrṇa-kalaśa (a jar filled with water) on the right and left sides were painted in 2007 CE on the occasion of Kājīlāla Avāle's jaṃkva. According to an Avāle family member, the icons of the phalcā depict the couple Jagata (Gvārā) Āju, who served in the Rāṇā Government, and his wife. He was of a higher status and was permitted to ride a horse. Jagata Avāle donated this phalcā six generations ago. An older statue of the donors was removed/stolen in the late 1990s and replaced soon thereafter.

When the thieves tried to steal the statue of Akṣobhya from the temple, the idol broke down into pieces. Later in 2008 CE, the saṅgha members of the Kvātha Bāhāḥ installed this new statue of the deity. Stone statues of Sāriputra and Maudgalyāyana flank Akṣobhya and a toraṇa is fixed on his top.

Dhaḥmā Phalcā, view of the painted front of the dhaḥmā (May 2019)

This Phalcā is known as the "dhaḥmā phalcā" because the dhaḥmās (the longitudinal main beams) of the Matsyendranāth chariot are stored here. 

A dhaḥmā is a shaft which is upturned at one end and passes through a chariot between the wheels. It is sometimes referred to as ghaḥmā. There is always a painting of Bhairava on the face of the upturned part. This is covered by a gilt copper image of the same deity. The dhaḥmā itself is considered to be Karkoṭaka Nāgarāja, the serpent deity who, legend tells, stretched itself across a river from one end to the other, thus enabling the king, a priest and a porter to cross the river when they went to collect Bungadyaḥ. However, the water of this river turned everything that touched it into stone. It was this power that gave it the name Śila Nadi: the stone river. The serpent deity crossed the river after helping the trio. As it crossed it accidentally let the tip of its tail dip into the river. The part that touched the water immediately turned into stone and fell off. This is why the other end of the dhaḥmā does not have a pointed tip like a serpent's tail (information by Rajendra Sakya 2015).

The four dhaḥmās measure ca. 60 cm in height, 1500 cm in length and 40 cm in breadth. They are damaged.

Normally the procession takes place in the months preceeding the monsoon rains, from April until May. However, when the 2015 earthquakes struck the chariot stopped en route between Bungamati and Patan, and the procession came to a halt. To avoid any bad luck that might be incurred by this, the procession was continued in September. These photos show some of the festivities that took place at this time.

Source: Gutschow 2011, 918

Before the 2015 earthquake, this Viṣṇu shrine was located on the upper floor. In it stood a four-handed Viṣṇu, holding śaṅkha, cakra, gadā and padma and standing in the sthānaka posture. Following the demolition of the upper storey, the Viṣṇu statue was placed in the sanctum of the Viṣṇu Mandira located behind the Sataḥ.

Mati Bāhāḥ, Śikharopari Bimba Caitya, view from E (November 2018)

This Caitya is located in front of the main door of the Bāhāḥ. The base of the Caitya is in a viṃśatikoṇa plan and raised by a stone plinth. A nāga winds across the lower story in a mountain-like design, with its head and tail facing north. These mountains represent the four mountains Jāmāco, Sipuco, Phūco and Dhināco, all of which surround the Kathmandu Valley. On top of the mountains in each of the four directions are images of Buddha. There are images of Tārā in the four corners. Some parts of these images are broken, though it seems that they were installed later.  Above the images are two layers of lotus petals. Above this, in turn, are kumbha, harmikā, trayodaśabhuvana and a pinnacle. A metal cãduvā supported by four iron angular rods in four corners can be found above the entire Caitya. These rods also support an oil-lamp balustrade. There is no inscription to provide information about the history of the object. However, Gutschow (1997, 257) dates it back to the 18th century.

Duru Bāhāḥ Nani, Bhīmasena statue, view from E (March 2019)

Bhīmasena is pictured pressing his enemy down with the knee of his left leg. He rips open the enemy’s chest with his left hand and pulls out a long portion of his entrails with his right hand or else raises a club over him. Individuals are often unable to identify the enemy in such representations, while others are not sure whether he is Duryodhana, Duḥśāsana or Kīcaka.

Gaṇeśa Shrine, Pulā̃ Cibhāḥ, view from W (November 2019)

The Pulā̃ Cibhā (lit. an old caitya) is located on the western side of the nani. Locals claim that this caitya is the oldest of the courtyard's three caityas. However, there seems to be no hard evidence to support their claim. The caitya has been painted with white lime. Four Buddha statues are placed in the niches at each of the four cardinal directions. Before the 2015 earthquake the caitya stood alone in an open space. However, after the earthquake people constructed a hut in its vicinity. This has caged the caitya in.

Buṅga Bahī, Aśoka caitya, view from NW (October 2019)

This caitya differs from other aśoka caityas because it has a śivaliṅga shape. The liṅga is plastered with mud mortar and is standing on top of a north-facing yonī. There are four small empty niches in the four cardinal directions of the liṅga. Locals assume that there is a caitya inside the śivaliṅga, and that this was covered for its protection during the expedition of philosopher Ādi Saṅkarācārya. The philosopher got rid of other heterodox religious traditions for the expansion of his own religious doctrine.

Sundarī Coka, Tusāhiti, panoramic view (from Kathmandu Valley Preservation Trust, 2010)

Tusāhiṭī is located at the centre of the Sundarī Coka. Tu is a Newari word meaning sugarcane, while sā means tasty. The name Tusāhiṭī therefore literally means 'the spout which gives water as tasty as the juice of sugarcane' (Shrestha 1996, 3). A couple of nāgas encircle the structure, and it is believed that they allow the outflow of the water from the hiṭī. The entrance to the hiṭī is further guarded by a pair of lions. The raised heads of the nāgas are particularly beautiful. The spout is embellished with figures of Lakṣmī Nārāyaṇa seated on Garuḍa. The images of Lakṣmī Nārāyaṇa and Garuḍa, as well as those of other aquatic animals on the spout are all gilded. A statue of Bhagīratha holding the spout in two hands is installed beneath the spout. On top of the spout, one can find a small stone temple believed to be a miniature version of the famous Krishna Temple of Patan Darbar Square (LAL1340). It is carved out of a single block of stone and contains no cella. The hiṭī is filled with Hindu images of Śaiva, Vaiśnava, Tantric and other astral divinities. Shrestha (1996, 4-5) suggests that this spout was constructed by Siddhinarasiṃha Malla and was not intended for bathing but rather to offer holy water to the gods. It is therefore better described as a libation spout rather than a royal bath. The hiṭī was renovated between 2017-18. 

The names of the gods whose images are placed in the hiṭī are listed below (in a clockwise direction):

Sundarī Cok, stone bed, view from W (May 2019)

This huge stone bed placed to the south of Tusāhiti is said to be the bed of King Siddhinarsiṃha Malla, and the place where he used to meditate. King Siddhinarasiṃha Malla was a great practitioner of yoga meditation. During winter, everyone else was shivering but the King used to rest on this bed wearing only a loin-cloth. During summer when the sun got very hot he wore many warm clothes and set the wood placed before him on fire. The stone bed of the king can still be found in the courtyard with these legends as its legacy. A statue of a monkey can be found to its north. The monkey is squatting down and holding a butter lamp in his hands, which rest on its lap. The figure may have once been used as a night lamp.

Matsyendranātha Mandira, Matsyendranātha statue in the sanctum, view from N (January 2020)

Buṅgadyaḥ is kept here for six months every year. During the other six months, he dwells in the Karuṇāmaya Mandira (BUN0001) of Bungmati. Patan’s greatest festival takes place when this god is brought out in a chariot on the full moon day of Vaiśākha. The procession leads all the way to Jawalakhel. The chariot procession began as a way to celebrate the arrival of Buṅga Dyaḥ in Nepal and the end of a devastating drought. Ā. Vajrācārya (1985, 84) mentions that Śubhaśrī Mitra of Karuṇācuka Bahī (LAL1560) made the statue, which is why the bahī was named after the deity. A Tibetan monk called Dharmasvāmin who stayed in the monastery of Svayambhū (Phags-pa Sin-kun) of the Valley around 1226-34 CE makes mention of a miraculous image of Avalokiteśvara made of sandalwood and painted red (Regmī 1965, 559-560). The present statue of the deity is made from two different materials. The head is made of clay while the rest of the body is made from metal. The clay section is painted every year before the deity is placed on the chariot.

This stone pillar is one of three pillars located in front of the temple. According to local elders, statues of King Narendradeva, Ācārya Bandhudatta and a Jyāpu used to be displayed on top of the lotus pedestals on the first day of every solar month. However, the tradition ended about three decades ago.

Karuṇāmaya Mandira, Buṅgadyaḥ, view from N (October 2019) 

The photo was taken in the temporary shrine (BUN0003), where Buṅgadyaḥ has been housed since the collapse of the Karuṇāmaya Temple.

Buṅgadyaḥ is kept in Buṅgamatī for six months a year; during the other six months he dwells in the esoteric shrine of Taḥ Bāhāḥ (LAL0050). Patan’s greatest festival occurs when this god is brought out in a chariot on the full moon day of Vaiśākha. The procession ends up in Jawalakhel.

The chariot procession was started to celebrate the arrival of Buṅga Dyaḥ in Nepal and the end of a devastating drought. Ā. Vajrācārya (1985, 84) mentions that Śubhaśrī Mitra of Karuṇācuka Bahī (LAL1560) made the statue, which is why the monastic building is named after the deity. A Tibetan monk called Dharmasvāmin who stayed in the monastery of Svayambhū (Phags-pa Sin-kun) of the Valley around 1226-34 mentions a miraculous image of Avalokiteśvara which was made of sandalwood painted in a red colour (Regmī 1965, 559-560). The present statue of the deity is made of two different elements; the head is made from clay while the rest of the body is made from metal. The terracotta is painted every year before the deity is placed on the chariot.

These shrines are attached to the back wall of the Ganedyaḥ temple. The left shrine belongs to Mahākāla. His statue was established by Suvarṇarāma Jośī and Suvarṇalakṣmī Jośī in 2014. A four-handed Sarasvatī statue is placed in the middle shrine. She is holding a rosary in her upper right hand and performing a gesture of varada with her lower right hand. She holds a book in her upper left hand and performs abhaya with the lower one. To the left of this Sarasvatī statue and in the third shrine stands Lakṣmī, who is holding a lotus bud.  Bangdel (1995, 475) dates this statue to the 15th century. A statue of Rādhākṛṣṇa has been placed to the right of the Sarasvatī shrine.

The four-handed Gaṇeśa statue holds a rosary and a radish in his right hands, and an axe and a sweet ball in his left hands. Bangdel (1995, 476) has dated this statue as being from the 18th century. A highly deteriorated stone statue can be found to the left of the main statue, and is said to be the original statue of the sanctum. A legend tells that a man named Hākucā replaced the old Gaṇeśa statue with a new one. The deity was furious. Blisters broke out across Hākucā's body, and after a period of intense suffering, he ultimately passed away.

This pavilion stands to the north of the pond. Underneath it, one can find a stone chamber which was used as a changing room for the royal family when taking baths. The chamber’s entrance is topped with a stone toraṇa and flanked by statues of Yamunā and Sarasvatī. The façade of the pavilion is sculpted with various incarnations of Viṣṇu. It has ten wooden carved columns. The roof is covered with jhĩgaṭī tiles and is topped with a metal finial. The chronicle (Nepālko Itihāsa Rājabhogamāla 1969, 24) states that this pavilion and the pond were built together and a wooden canopy (cãduvā) was once fixed over the pavilion.

Aśoka Stūpa North, Tārā shrine, view from the NW (December 2018)

Inside the north-western niche of the stūpa is a stone image of Tārā sitting in the vajrāsana.  She is holding a gem with her right arm and a lotus stalk with her left arm.

Aśoka Stūpa North, vajradhātu caitya with Buddha statues in the niches, view from E (December 2018)

As is typical of such caitya, images of four Buddhas are placed inside the niches and garbha is made. No eyes or urṇā have been drawn in the harmikā. Only 9 bhuvanas have been made above the harmikā, which provides evidence for the argument that this caitya is more archaic. On the northern plinth of the caitya is an image of a standing Buddha which is severely worn down. Bangdel (1995, 288) has dated this image back to the 5th century. Next to the image to the south there is a stone which appears to be a faded stone inscription. On the western plinth of the caitya is an image of Vairocana and at the northern plinth is an image of Amitābha, both severly eroded. At the northeast corner of the caitya is a bell that was donated in NS 1119.

Keśavanārāyaṇa Coka, the courtyard with Keśavanārāyaṇa temple, view from NE (photo by Tuomo Manninen, 1995)

 

West-facomg dome-style Keśavanārāyaṇa temple stands in the middle of the square-shaped courtyard. The name of the courtyard is given after the name of the temple. Gutschow (2011, 207) assumes that the temple was made by the Mahāpātras of Lalitpur incorporating two Licchavi columns. Statues of Nārāyaṇa, Lakṣmī and Garuḍa are standing in the sanctum of the temple. Similar statue of other temples of the valley are called Śrīdhara Viṣṇu. Beside these, there are images of Kṛṣṇa and his two wives.

The Narayan Temple is in a poor state of repair with edge stones and terracotta features missing.

Dyaḥ Sataḥ, an aniconic image of Hanumān, view from W (November 2019)

This triangular hole on the Satah's wall is located to the west of the main entrance of Bhṛṅgāreśvara Mandira and is worshipped as an aniconic image of Hanumān by local residents. Locals believe that offerings of kã̄sa (stalk of the grass Saccharum spontaneum) and varieties of limes or wild limes (jyāmira/bimiro) will entice the aniconic Hnumān to cure children from stomach ailments and keep evil spirits away from them.

Mū Guitaḥ Bahī, pillar, view from W (June 2019)

This pillar is located to the north of the aśoka caitya. Although at first glance the pillar appears simple, the top part has been given the form of a crown (uṣṇīṣacūḍāmaṇi). There are two large maṇḍapas to the north of the pillar.

This Lichhavi period Caitya is located in front of the esoteric god house. It contains images of four Bodhisattvas in four directions. Above the Bodhisattva images, one can find images of Buddhas flanked by Tārās. According to local people, all 16 niches were originally empty; the statues are more recent additions. Gutschow (1997, 218) suggests the caitya was constructed some time between the 9th - 13th century. There are nine planetary maṇḍalas to the south and west of the Caitya.

Guitaḥ Phalcā 2, Nāmasaṅgīti shrine, view from W (August 2019)

The Nāmasaṅgīti shrine is embedded in the eastern wall of the Phalcā. A stone statue of Nāmasaṅgīti has been placed in a niche of the shrine. Nāmasaṅgīti is one of the important manifesta­tions of Mañjuśrī, the embodiment of wisdom of all the Buddhas. This statue shows him with one head and twelve arms and seated with his hands in a dhyānamudrā position. The arms above his head are in the uttarabodhi mudrā position i.e two hands folded to form a gesture of prostration. Two hands are at his breast level and are performing dharmacakra mudrā. Two other hands are in tarpaṇa mudrā i.e about to offer water from the alms bowl. Another pair of hands holds an alms bowl in his lap, whilst the hands at his shoulder level hold a sword and scripture on a lotus and the last set hold a bow and arrow.

A caitya-shaped pinnacle has been placed on top of the shrine.
