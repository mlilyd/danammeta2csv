"Silkhu Phalcā, modern Phalcā, view from E (May 2020)This Phalcā is located to the south of the Sikhu Phalcā. The inscription attached to its wall mentions that it was commissioned by Baccurāma and his three sons in VS 1981 (1924 CE). The Phalcā was maintained by Baccurāma’s grandson Śivapradāsa. Around VS 2058 (2001 CE) Surajanātha, another grandson of Baccurāma, reconstructed the Phalcā as a crudely built one-storey brick and concrete structure. It is further mentioned that the land, located to the west from this Phalcā has been secured to support religious functions and the upkeep of the Phalcā. The cremation ground situated in front of the Phalcā is used by the Mālī community of Bhājaṅgala. During the funeral nāyakhiṃ and kāhā music is played nearby the Phalcā.CHO4100-004"
